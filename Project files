Project files
You’re provided with a ‘user_journey_raw.csv’ file. It includes data about the journeys of many users, with 
their user and session ID columns, the plan they purchased (Monthly, Quarterly, or Annual), and a 
user journey string for each session—a string of all the pages they visited during the session, in order and 
separated by dashes (-). For instance, Homepage-Pricing-Courses is a string indicating that this user first visited
the Homepage, then went to Pricing before finally landing on the Courses page. The data provided for this User Journey
Analysis in Python project has been cleaned, and the users’ privacy has been protected.
