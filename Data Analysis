Given the preprocessed data, you can begin your analysis in a new notebook to keep matters clean. Now is the time to think what metrics we can generate to obtain valuable statistics about the behavior of purchasing customers. Please take your time and think of as many such metrics as possible. Meanwhile, consider the following list of metrics we’d like you to attempt to successfully complete the project:

Page count is the most fundamental metric; it counts how many times each page can be found in all user journeys.
Page presence is similar to ‘page count’ but counts each page only once if it exists in a journey; it shows how many times each page is part of a journey
Page destination is a metric that shows the most frequent follow-ups after every page. It looks at every page and counts which pages follow next. If one is interested in what the users do after visiting page X, they can consult this metric.
Page sequences look at what the most popular run of N pages is. I will consult this metric if I’m interested in the sequence of three (or any other number) pages that most often shows up. Count each sequence only once per journey.
Journey length is a straightforward metric that considers the average length of a user journey in terms of pages.
You can create a function for each of these key metrics. Recall, however, that the data provided also had a subscription plan column. A vital part of the analysis is finding patterns and differences between buyers’ behavior of different plans. For example, compare the journey of monthly users versus the one of annual users. This is why it’s essential to incorporate a plan parameter in these functions, allowing a data scientist to obtain the metrics for all subscription plans or any specific one.

Completing all of this, you should’ve created the necessary code to make a complete analysis. You can check what all the metrics give and tinker with the preprocessing to see how the metrics change.
