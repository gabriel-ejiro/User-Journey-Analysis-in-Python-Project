Now you have finished all the code, implementing the metrics you thought were helpful. Everything is ready for a data scientist
to analyze the data.

Itâ€™s time to see if this analysis can gain insights. You can check how the users that purchased different subscription plans
 behave. Is there any significance in aggregating only some sessions, or should we check all of them? Are there any pages
that you would exclude from the analysis? And importantly, do you have any suggestions for further data analysis complementary 
to
this one that will help understand the user behavior before purchase?
