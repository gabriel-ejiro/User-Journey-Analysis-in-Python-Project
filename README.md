# User-Journey-Analysis-in-Python-Project

Case Description
In this User Journey Analysis in Python project, you’ll explore real-world data from 365’s online subscription-based learning platform and analyze user behavior. Generally, ‘user journey’ refers to each user’s experience while exploring your product or platform. In other words, it’s the sequence of pages each user visited before purchasing a subscription.

Analyzing this type of data is an essential task for businesses because it can let them identify key pages (or sequences of pages) that help users convert into paying customers. It can also give insight into how users behave so they can structure their marketing campaigns or identify unnecessary pages.

Hence, your task will be to build the tools necessary to analyze many different users’ website journeys. You must think carefully about what is needed and how it can be achieved.

The project focuses more on building all the right tools and functions in Python to generate helpful metrics. At the same time, you should carefully examine these metrics and obtain beneficial insights.
